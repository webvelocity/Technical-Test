<h1>Fullcomms Developer Technical Test</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Fullcomms developer tech test!</p>
<p>This exercise will give you a small insight into what fullcomms does best and that's building expertly designed
 websites, beautifully crafted frontends and cleanly written back-end code.
 </p>
 
 <p>This test will demonstrate your abilities to take a design and build it for both Desktop and mobile as well as
  demonstrate your knowledge of the MVC pattern within a framework, leveraging the frameworks features to delivery
   clean code.
  </p>
  
  <p>To get started, please fork off of this repo into your own repository.</p>
 
 <h3>The Brief</h3>
 <p>At Fullcomms we pride ourselves in developing and delivering quality websites & web applications for our
  various clients by writing clean and concise code, ensuring the project is robust and well built so the clients have
   peace of mind with what they are receiving.
 </p>
  
<p>For this Technical test we would like you to look at the following design <a href="https://drive.google.com
/drive/folders/1PXZn8xtDVfdcKR5q_d-EhAjLtYGX7GKc?usp=sharing">Design Sample.</a>.</p>

<h5>The scenario</h5>
<p>The "Client" has requested this SPA landing page to be built to or as close to as the design so they can promote
 some of the properties they have on sale, they've requested that it should work on both a traditional desktop
  computer as well as a mobile device.
</p>
<p>The client is also requesting that the form which is part of the design takes the data and processes it correctly
 into a permanent datastore such as MySQL database or PostgresSQL, this information and the form it self should follo
  w any GDPR guidelines.
 </p>
 
 <p>The client has also requested a method of communication from the website to let him and his workers know that a
  new lead from the website has landed so they can action it correctly. They do not wish to receive multiple emails
   from the same client within a 24 time period.
 </p>
 
 <p>Optionally the client has requested a secure way to view, edit and download a copy of this information, though it
  is not a phase 1 request, they would be pleased to receive this early and could bolster our working relationship
   with them in future work.
 </p>
 
<h5>What we will be looking at</h5>

<h6>Frontend Ability</h6>
<ul>
<li>The use of a Frontend Framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation</li>
<li>Well written SASS/LESS or CSS files</li>
<li>The code and structure of both style and any used javascript files</li>
<li>Appropriate use of helper classes</li>
<li>Use of a responsive Grid design</li>
</ul>
<h6>Backend Ability</h6>
<ul>
<li>The use of MVC pattern within a PHP framework such as Laravel though other frameworks are acceptable</li>
<li>Appropriate use of Data Models & Relationships between models</li>
<li>Cleanly written Controllers</li>
<li>Use of available packages and/or framework functionality</li>
<li>Practising and following the PSR coding styles (PSR12 preferred)</li>
<li>Ability to derive data models from visual design</li>
</ul>

<h5>Additional Notes</h5>

<p>Please continuously commit to GIT so we can keep track of your progression, please note there is no time limit
 apart from the agreed upon submission date so take your time and and focus on delivering your best code.
</p>

<p>Additionally, any extra uses of framework features and uses which assist with the "client's" need will be assessed
 but
is not mandatory to the final delivery. Any visuals created outside the design will not be assessed so don't feel
the need to create anything exceptional or over the top.</p>
  
<p>We would prefer all the code is contained and written within a Laravel Project (the code supplied) to demonstrate
 your knowledge and experience with the framework however you are free to use any framework you choose as long as it
  is using the MVC pattern, please note you will be expected to work with Laravel.</p>
  
<p>Any additional technologies use in conjunction with a framework such as VUEjs or ReactJs is entirely up to you but
   will not be reviewed as we are only interested in your frontend ability, ability to deliver a design and your core
    PHP skills within the Laravel or similar framework.</p>
    
 <h3>Submission</h3>
 <p>Once you've completed the test, please contact us with the repository link for us to clone down and build, please
  include any instructions to get it up and running as we can only assess code which will run and work so any
   information and commands we need to run will be great.
 </p>
