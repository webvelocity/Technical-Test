<h1>Fullcomms Developer Technical Test</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Fullcomms developer tech test!</p>
<p>This exercise will give you a small insight to what we do and what we're looking for in a developer, there are no
 trick questions or purpose hidden bit of code to throw you off so there is nothing to worry about. There is no time-limit 
 other than the discussed delivery date given to you by us so take along as you need to between starting and handing
  it in.
 </p>
 
 <h3>The Brief</h3>
 <p>At Fullcomms we pride ourselves in delivering crisp looking websites for our clients as well as writing robust,clean
  and concise code.</p>
  
<p>For this technical test we would like you the developer to build a simple landing page which will provide a little
 information about the company website, display some property cards and little call to action sections which would
  drive traffic to other areas of the websites such.</p>
  <p>We would also like a secondary page where a potential customer
   could enter in their information which is then stored into a database and is viewable by the company.
 </p>
 
 <p>To give you an example and idea of what we mean by landing page please look at the following design and links to
  some of our previous design builds</p>

 <a href='https://yourvividhome.co.uk/'>Vivid Homes</a><br>
 
 <p>Usually the design is broken into;</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Top Bar Navigation</li>
 <li>Hero Image and Text</li>
 <li>Property cards</li>
 <li>Promotion Box containing a reference to another page</li>
 <li>Footer with information</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Getting Started</h3>
 <p>To get started, simply download a copy / fork this off from this repository and use it to push to your own
  repository
  which we will
  then use to assess once you've completed.
 </p>
 
 <p>Alternatively if you plan to use any other framework other than laravel then please skip cloning or forking off
  this repository
 </p>
 
 <h3>The Deliverables</h3>
 <p>For this test we expect a single page homepage which demonstrates and shows off your frontend HTML/CSS skillet
  as well as your ability to build responsive markup which looks both clean and crisp on  Desktop, Tablet and
   Mobile viewports. We would also expect a lesser designed page which contains a form which allows customers to submit
    their information and interest in a particular home on this mock website also taking into consideration additional
     form elements and functionality you may add to enhance user experience.
  </p>
  
  <p>Data submitted on the form <strong>must</strong> save to a persistent data storage such as a MySQL database
  , the database structure should include appropriate datatypes. What database technology you chose to use it
   entirely up to you as long as the form data is saved and is accessible.
  </p>
 
 
 <h4>What we will be looking for</h4>
 
 <h5>Frontend</h5>
<ul>
<li>The use of frontend framework such as Bootstrap / Foundation with Bootstrap 4 being preferred.</li>
<li>Well written SASS/LESS or CSS</li>
<li>The structure of the style files and any Javascript files</li>
<li>Appropriate use of helper classes</li>
<li>Responsive Grid structure to meet design on desktop and mobile platforms</li>
</ul>

<h5>Backend</h5>
<ul>
<li>PHP code written within the Laravel 8.X framework though another MVC framework will be accepted</li>
<li>Appropriate use of data Models and migration files</li>
<li>Cleanly written Controller logic</li>
<li>Use of PSR12 coding standards</li>
</ul>

<h5>Optional addtions</h5>
<ul>
<li>Authenticated login / view to display the data captured</li>
<li>A way to export the data for use outside of the database</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Please do not spend too much time or over-engineer a solution,  we are assessing you based on how you take the small
 requires and examples given to you and how you build it within an MVC framework and utilize the frameworks built in
  features to deliver a solution which looks good on all devices and is written cleanly.
</p>

<p>Any additional views created outside of the two requested views will not be assessed on frontend ability.</p>

<h4>Submission</h4>
<p>Once you've completed push your code to your repository for us to clone down and run. Please leave instructions on
 how to run your project including any composer, npm or artisan commands to run.
</p>

<p>Please also include any additional details such as which version of PHP you've written your code in.</p>

<p>Please email us to let us know when the code is ready for assessment</p>
